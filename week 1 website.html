    <h2>In search of most precious fruit . . . </h2>

    <p>
        I set out at night, rolled through four hours of dark, pausing only for sustenance: a fish in cold slices, some salt, eaten on the move. When I arrived, thirsty and shuddering, I was welcomed only by beasts - <div style=color:sienna>brown dog</div>, white cat, green cat - whose spines brushed against my shins as I descended into a cave without light, where my bare feet met cold stone. There I consulted my various instruments t Everything I had been told about this fruit meant this was worth the journey. 
    </p>

    <p>
        At dawn I was awoken by a flicker of light. A small arm retreated from the entrance to my cave. Some sentry had registered my presence. He was hoping I would register his. I turned away, fearful of confrontation, too weak to heed any call. My sleep was fitful, though, and in time he returned, and, in a tiny voice of urgency, summoned me up from my cave. I stirred slowly. I shook the crust from my eyes. It was no hour to be moving. But I knew the reward was immeasurable. I was here for this fruit and this small sentry knew its location better than anyone. Could I trust his intentions? Could you?

    </p>

    <p>
        I reviewed what I knew about the fruit:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>It is a precious fruit</li>
        <li> It produces feelings of total and ineffable warmth</li>
        <li>It is a shapeshifter, never appearing the same in two photographs taken in consecutive days</li>
        <li> It assumes the form of a leaping frog, or of a dense yam</li>
        <li>It smells like sweet air except for when it smells like an off egg</li>
        <li>It is better held than eaten</li>
        <li>It can make a sound</li>
        <li>It can be soundless</li>
        <li>It can be yours or mine</li>
      </ul>

      <input type="checkbox"> Are you ready to proceed?
