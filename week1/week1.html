    <h2>In search of most precious fruit . . . </h2>

    <p>
        I set out at night, rolled through four hours of dark, pausing only for sustenance: a fish in cold slices, some salt, eaten on the move. When I arrived, thirsty and shuddering, I was welcomed only by beasts - brown dog, white cat, green cat - whose spines brushed against my shins as I descended into a cave without light. There I fell quiet. Everything I knew about this fruit meant this was worth the journey. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Before dawn I awoke to a flicker of light. Another flicker. An arm slunk back from the entrance to my cave. Some small sentry had registered my presence. Now he was goading me to follow him. I turned away, too weak to heed any call before the sun. My sleep was already broken, though, and soon enough he was back, with a tiny voice of urgency, summoning me from my cave. It was no hour to be moving, but I was seeking this fruit and he would be my guide.

    </p>

    <p>
        Before my eyes opened I reviewed what I knew of this fruit:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is a precious fruit</li>
        <li>It produces a feeling of total ineffable warmth</li>
        <li>It is a shapeshifter, never appearing the same in two photographs</li>
        <li>It can assume the form of a leaping frog, or of a dense yam</li>
        <li>It smells like sweet air, except for when it smells like an off egg</li>
        <li>It is better held than eaten</li>
        <li>It can make a sound</li>
        <li>It can be soundless</li>
        <li>It can be yours or mine</li>
      </ul>

      <p><input type="checkbox"> So he wanted to know: would I follow?</p>
    
      <p>The guide pattered up the steps from my cave. I came after, slowly at first. Soon I realized I was so close to this fruit that, even as I kneaded sand from my eyes, I wanted not to walk but to . . .</p>
